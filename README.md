# CS-3310-Project-1

Names: Jeremy , Nicholas Ramirez-Ornelas

Date: 11-6-22

Class: CS3310.02

Professor: Huong Luu

Program Description:

Program in Java or C++ the following algorithms that we covered in the class:

Classical matrix multiplication
Naive divide-and-conquer matrix multiplication
Strassen’s matrix multiplication
Let the matrix size be n ×n. You can assume n is a power of 2. Carry out a complete test of your algorithms with random matrices of size n = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, ... (up to the largest size of n that your computer can handle). In order to obtain more accurate results, each algorithm should be tested many times with different matrices of the same size. The total time spent is then divided by the number of times the algorithm is performed to obtain the time taken to solve instances of size n.

Write a detailed report together with graphs explaining the data sets, test strategies and explanation of the results. Include the answer for the following questions: What are the theoretical complexity comparisons of the three algorithms ? Is one algorithm always faster than the others ? Conclude your report with the strength and constraints of your work.
